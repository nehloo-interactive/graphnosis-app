Graphs let you organize your cortex into distinct namespaces. Sensitivity tiers let you decide how much of each graph an AI is allowed to see — including the option to block AI access entirely.

**Important:** even for graphs with open tiers, your AI never receives everything in that graph. On every `recall` call, Graphnosis performs a semantic search and returns only the nodes most relevant to your current question, subject to the token cap for that graph. The rest stays encrypted and untouched. This is intentional — Graphnosis acts as your hippocampus, retrieving targeted memory traces, not dumping your files.

## Multiple graphs

A single cortex can hold multiple graphs. You might create:

- `work` — project notes, meeting summaries, technical decisions
- `personal` — journal entries, health notes, finance snippets
- `research` — papers, articles, reference material

Each graph is independent: its own sensitivity tier, its own token budget, its own sources. When the AI calls `recall`, it searches across all graphs you've granted it access to, respecting each graph's tier.

### Creating a graph

Open the Graphnosis window → click **+ New Graph** → give it a name and choose a sensitivity tier.

## Sensitivity tiers

Every graph is assigned one of three tiers:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th>What it means</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><code>public</code></td><td>Content may be surfaced to any AI client without restriction.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><code>personal</code></td><td>Content is surfaced only when the AI explicitly asks for context (no proactive injection). Token cap applies.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><code>sensitive</code></td><td>Excluded from AI recall by default. Surfaced only if you explicitly turn on "share with AI" for the engram — and even then, only under a tight cap.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Tiers are a hard cap, enforced by the sidecar before any content leaves the cortex. The AI model itself never sees the tier configuration — it simply doesn't receive content above its allowed level.

### Tier behavior in practice

**`public` graphs** — chunks flow freely into AI context. Proactive injection is enabled. Best for reference material, documentation, public notes.

**`personal` graphs** — chunks are only returned when `recall` is called explicitly. Proactive injection is disabled. The token cap limits how much context can be returned per conversation turn. Best for personal notes, journal entries, work summaries.

**`sensitive` graphs** — by default the sidecar returns zero results for `recall` queries targeting this graph; the AI is never told why, it just gets no results. If you deliberately turn on "share with AI" for a sensitive graph, recall returns at most a tight cap — 5 nodes / 500 tokens. You can always search and review these memories in the Graphnosis UI. Best for health information, financial records, anything you want to keep entirely local.

## How much a recall returns

Recall is **budgeted per call**, not by a fixed per-tier number. When an AI client calls `recall`, it requests a token budget and a node count, and Graphnosis enforces a hard ceiling on both:

| Limit | Default | Hard cap |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens attached per recall | 2,000 | 8,000 |
| Memory nodes attached per recall | 20 | 50 |

That budget is shared across every engram the recall touches — Graphnosis fills it with the most relevant memories wherever they live, so no single engram can monopolize your AI's context window.

Tiers shape this further: a `public` or `personal` engram can contribute up to the full budget, while a `sensitive` engram contributes **nothing** unless you have explicitly turned on "share with AI" for it — and even then it is held to a tight **5 nodes / 500 tokens**.

## Configuring policy.json

`policy.json` lives in the root of your cortex folder. It is not encrypted (it contains only policy rules, not content). You can edit it directly:

```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "work": {
      "tier": "personal",
      "maxTokensPerRecall": 3000
    },
    "research": {
      "tier": "public",
      "maxTokensPerRecall": 6000
    },
    "health": {
      "tier": "sensitive"
    }
  },
  "globalMaxTokensPerTurn": 8000
}
```

Changes to `policy.json` take effect immediately — no restart required. The sidecar watches the file for changes.

### `globalMaxTokensPerTurn`

This is a hard ceiling across all graphs combined. Even if individual graph caps add up to more, the sidecar will truncate the total context to this limit. Default: `8000`.

## Moving sources between engrams

Sources aren't permanently bound to the engram they were ingested into. You can reassign a source at any time from the Sources pane — hover the row, click **Move to…**, and pick the destination.

If you need a new engram as the destination, select **New Engram…** from the dropdown, type a name, and Graphnosis will create it and move the source in one step.

Moving a source is instant and non-destructive. All chunks, embeddings, and cached content travel with it. The AI clients reflect the new location on the next `recall` call — no restart or re-ingest needed. The moved source is governed by the destination engram's sensitivity tier immediately after the move.

**Cross-engram connections are rebuilt immediately after every move.** When a source moves, Graphnosis removes its old cross-engram links (they referenced the now-deleted node IDs in the origin engram), re-ingests the content into the destination with fresh node IDs, and immediately runs a cross-engram linking pass — without waiting for the next scheduled pass (every 6 hours). Related memories in other engrams are re-connected automatically. You don't need to trigger anything manually.

Typical reasons to move a source:

- You ingested a work document into `personal` by accident — move it to `work`
- A research paper turned out to be closely related to a specific project — move it into that project's engram for tighter recall
- You're splitting a large general-purpose engram into topic-specific ones over time

## Archiving an engram

Archiving hides an engram from all in-app pickers and dropdowns — sources, the engram switcher, the 3D view — without touching its data. The graph file, all nodes, embeddings, and cross-engram connections remain exactly as they were. Nothing is removed, weakened, or re-indexed.

Archiving is fully reversible: click **Unarchive** and the engram reappears immediately with all its connections intact. Cross-engram links survive the archive/unarchive cycle unchanged.

Only **Delete** permanently removes an engram and purges its cross-engram connections from the store.

## Which graphs does a client see?

By default, all graphs in the cortex are visible to any connected MCP client, subject to their tier. If you want to expose only specific graphs to a specific AI client, you can scope the sidecar using the `GRAPHNOSIS_GRAPHS` environment variable (see [Environment Variables](/reference/environment-variables/)).
